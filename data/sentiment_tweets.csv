Choose well!"
2020-11-30,"Transaction fees are a complicated topic, but they're part of what makes Bitcoin free and decentralized. No one but you can decide how ""important"" a transaction is. You decide and you tell the miners with your fee choice. 

/19"
2020-11-30,"That also means that sometimes your transaction will get dropped from most places but re-broadcast by nodes that have kept it. That can delay the eventual confirmation/rejection of your Tx, leaving it in limbo longer. 

/18"
2020-11-30,"The queue where transactions are held before confirmation is called ""the mempool"". Thing is however, there is no ""the"" mempool. There is ""a mempool"" on every Bitcoin node. It's a decentralized system. Every node keeps a mempool of waiting transactions. 

/17"
2020-11-30,"That's because the reason the network isn't confirming it is that there are too many transactions queued competing for space. The queue itself is limited in size, so the same thing (congestion) preventing your Tx from confirming is likely to cause it to be dropped faster too.
/16"
2020-11-30,"How long can a transaction stay ""stuck"". If the network remains congested and the fee remains low, it can be up to 14 days before the network drops it and you can see the balance again. ""Up to"" because it usually takes 2-3 days before the network drops your Tx.

/15"
2020-11-30,"The transaction spending hasn't happened until... it has. Before confirmation, you have the money. After confirmation the recipient has the money. A block mined containing your Tx signals the change in state. 

/14"
2020-11-30,"In order to prevent weird user behavior, your wallet will ""hide"" the balance of coins that you have tried to spend with a pending transaction. It will show your balance decreased by that amount. But in reality, the coins are still in your wallet.

/13"
2020-11-30,"Bitcoin transactions are ""atomic"", meaning they are indivisible. The money is not removed from your wallet and sent somewhere before arriving at another wallet. If the transaction isn't confirmed, you have the money. If it is confirmed, the recipient has the money. No limbo

/12"
2020-11-30,"First of all, DON'T PANIC. It's important to understand that in Bitcoin your money can't get lost ""in limbo"". If you create a transaction and it is not getting confirmed, your money is not at risk of being lost. It will either confirm or it won't and your money is safe

/11"
2020-11-30,"Now, you're ready to send a transaction. If you have RBF, pick a low fee and see what happens. Later you can increase the fee and keep increasing it until you get the result you want. But what if you already sent a transaction, without RBF and it got stuck?

/10"
2020-11-30,"Again, good wallets do Replace-By-Fee (RBF) and Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) to help you manage a congested network and not get your Tx stuck. If your wallet doesn't do those things... consider changing wallets. 

/9"
2020-11-30,"Before sending a transaction you should also check if your wallet supports fee ""bumping"" with RBF or CPFP. If you can later ""bump"" the fee up, you can afford to be cheap at first and see if you get lucky. If you can't bump, you run the risk of getting your Tx stuck. 

/8"
2020-11-30,"If you use a wallet that creates ""legacy"" addresses that start with a ""1"", then choose a different wallet and move your money when the network isn't congested. 

Addresses that start with ""3"" (wrapped Segwit) are better. Those that start with ""bc1"" (native Segwit)  are best

/7"
2020-11-30,"If your wallet doesn't allow you to estimate fees or its fee estimation seems to be too conservative, use a different wallet. Another big reason for high fees is legacy address use. Different bitcoin addresses cost up to 40% less in fees for the sender. 

/6"
2020-11-30,"Some wallets won't let you set the fee rate or confirmation target. Some wallets also estimate fees very conservatively and aggressively overpay fees. That's because if your transaction is stuck you complain to the wallet devs. If you overpay fees you blame the bitcoin devs

/5"
2020-11-30,"At a current fee rate, you might have to pay 0.0002 BTC or so to get your transaction confirmed within 3 blocks. That's for a typical sized transaction.

2020-09-21,This isn't good news. This is the excuse they will use to double down on surveillance and control. To make money a tool of naked political power. No matter how many billions these measures condemn to poverty.
2020-09-21,"The solution is to stop trying to use money (a tool) to fight crime (human nature). But if you think the hypocrites will back down and adopt sensible systems and laws that enable human trade and economic inclusion, you are wrong. They will double down with even more control"
2020-09-21,"This FinCen leak is worthy of our ridicule because it reveals the hypocrisy of those who argue that crypto-currency is for money launderers. Banking *is* money laundering on a massive scale. But the solution is not to tighten controls on money. That won't work

15/"
2020-09-21,"The only type of money (crypto) that poor, undocumented, oppressed, and controlled populations can use will of course be attacked. But they will not have any choice but to continue to use cryptocurrency. Billions are already unbanked by fiat controls. 

14/"
2020-09-21,"Then the war on cash and the war on ""illicit"" money becomes an all out war on the only money that still works. The free, open, borderless, neutral, immutable, censorship resistant money that crypto-currencies like Bitcoin offer

13/"
2020-09-21,"Open and private crypto-currencies won't comply with these regulations, because they CAN'T comply without breaking every feature and capability they have. If some try to comply they will have to compete against gov-crypto and facebook-crypto (they will lose)

12/"
2020-09-21,"That makes crypto-currency a systemic threat, not to the economic nature of national money, but to the control and surveillance system of geopolitical money. Math money doesn't play politics, which makes it automatically ""rogue"" money. 

11/"
2020-09-21,"More and more people will need to use cryptocurrency in order to participate in the global economy, because control-currency doesn't work as money. A medium of exchange can't also work as a medium of control. They break money to stop crime, even though it is a futile effort

10/"
2020-09-21,"Then of course, the need and value of open financial systems based on open, private, and uncensorable cryptocurrencies will increase dramatically. When all the money in the world has been deliberately broken to serve this unachievable goal, the only money that works is crypto

9/"
2020-09-21,"These new rules will make government surveillance worse and will erode democratic institutions. They will make it possible for dictators to economically surveil, control, and eventually extinguish any opposition. They will use US surveillance tech to impose financial fascism

8/"
2020-09-21,"As these new rules are applied, banking will become even harder for poor people, undocumented people and people on the fringes of society. It won't stop criminals from criming. It will stop poor people from rising out of poverty. It will make banks even more competition-proof

7/"
2020-09-21,"These new rules will also not work. These new rules will also corrupt more bankers, regulators, cops and politicians. These new rules will destroy opportunity for millions more people. But they will offer the comfort of righteous rhetoric against evil while creating more evil

6/"
2020-09-21,"But despite this obvious truth, nothing is going to change. In fact, this report will be used to *increase* the use of controls and surveillance. In govt if something doesn't work, you do MORE of it. So this will result in stricter AML/CTF rules. 

5/"
2020-09-21,"""Worse than Useless"" is the title of a talk I gave about this topic. For the illusion of unatainable security and crime fighting we get two obvious and unavoidable results: billions cut out of the financial system and enormous corrupting power given to regulators and bankers.

4/"
2020-09-21,"I've talked about this extensively. Not only is the use of money as a crime-control mechanism ineffective, it has terrible consequences that increase poverty for billions by creating economic exclusion. So it's not just useless, it is ""Worse than Useless""

3/"
2020-09-21,"See the correct analysis of this news is that AML/CTF and KYC don't work. They will never work because they try to control the *tool* not the *criminal act*. It's not the money that is illicit, it's the use of that money to commit crimes. 

2/"
2020-09-21,"A lot of people who are into cryptocurrencies will see this FinCen leak as vindication and proof that banks are money launderers. 

But, this will be used against cryptocurrencies...

2020-09-02,"@AlfredodeCandi1 @electrum @APompliano @gavinandresen @adam3us No, as I said this is bad advice. It is safer to have a single hardware wallet that is properly backed up, than splitting across many. It is very difficult to properly backup several seeds in several safe locations"

2020-08-10,"The consensus mechanism can count the *exact* issuance of ETH, as long as you set a specific block height that has had all it's uncles counted and use that as a point of reference. 

/13"
2020-08-10,"It's important to understand that uncles arrive with a slight delay from the parent block and are incorporated on an ""eventual"" basis up to 6 blocks after the parent. This means the issuance at any height isn't finalized until a few blocks later, when all uncles are counted. 
/12"
2020-08-10,"Ok I lied, it's 3 purposes - 
(3) The rewarding of uncles reduces the incentive of mining empty blocks, since the race is not winner-takes all. 

/11"
2020-08-10,"(2) It acts as a sort of on-chain mining pool mechanism, since it doesn't penalize second-finish miners with a zero reward. This makes lower-hashrate miners able to compete as solo miners without losing potential reward

/10"
2020-08-10,"This mechanism serves two purposes: 

(1) it allows much faster block times (40x of bitcoin), without creating a whole mess of stale blocks that get no reward. Ethereum doesn't discard stales, it rewards them

/9"
2020-08-10,"This is a critical point to understand: ETH supply issued as rewards doesn't go 100% to the winning block each confirmation. In Ethereum, up to 87% of the block reward goes to uncles, and some is further distributed to nephews (children of uncles). Part also goes to the parent
/8"
2020-08-10,"Then there are ""uncles"". In Bitcoin, PoW is a winner-takes-all mechanism. Not in Ethereum, which uses a Greedy Heaviest Observed Tree (GHOST) protocol to include stale blocks with a lower reward. These are caller ""uncles"" or ""ommers""

/7"
2020-08-10,"Bitcoin does 1 block every 10 minutes. Ethereum does ~40 in that time. So exactly when you ask the question, will determine what answer you get. It won't be a stable answer for 10 minutes, it will change every 15-30 seconds or so. 

/6"
2020-08-10,"Then there's the nuance of burn addresses. Where in Bitcoin there are some assumed burn addresses, there's none universally recognized. In Ethereum however, the 0x0 address (used for contract registration) is in effect a burn address. Do you count that ETH? Some do some don't

/5"
2020-08-10,"There's also the fact that Ethereum uses an account-balance based system instead of a coin-fragment (UTXO) system. That means that counting current ETH in circulation is not as simple as finding all UTXO in Bitcoin. Nevertheless it is possible - you just have to scan the chain
/4"
2020-08-10,"You can easily see how this plays out in Bitcoin too, if you've paid any attention to all the errors in popular blockchain explorers over the years. Take a Bitcoin metric like ""current hashrate"" and you will find a dozen different answers depending on where you look

/3"
2020-08-10,"First of all a block explorer is a very limited view of any blockchain. These are user-interface tools that abstract important details and translate them for the user's benefit. They each have a point-of-view that is the result of their data collection and analysis methodology
/2"
2020-08-10,"This whole ""what is ETH supply"" thing is a silly gotcha that doesn't make much sense if you understand how Ethereum works. It's no better than the silly gotchas Schiff and Roubini level at bitcoin.

2020-08-09,"@NerdyNormie @SummersBeccy @evanashapiro @maxkeiser @adam3us @ToneVays @CharlieShrem @PeterMcCormack Then there's the fact that nowhere is any other participant in consensus mentioned. In my model, there are 5 constituencies of consensus, none of which can act alone:

- Developers
- Miners
- Exchanges
- Merchants
- Users/Wallets

But here it is presented as 100% miner-controlled"
2020-08-09,"@NerdyNormie @SummersBeccy @evanashapiro @maxkeiser @adam3us @ToneVays @CharlieShrem @PeterMcCormack Once again, mining pools are conflated with hash rate (a common trope of shallow critiques of Bitcoin), and no evidence is provided as to the extrapolation that the hash rate is in China. 

It's just stated based on an incorrect assumption and with no proof."
2020-08-09,"@NerdyNormie @SummersBeccy @evanashapiro @maxkeiser @adam3us @ToneVays @CharlieShrem @PeterMcCormack I'm no maximalist. 

Pretty much the entire argument in this article is belied by the fact that the miners cannot change consensus rules, as demonstrated in 2017 when they overwhelmingly wanted to (big blocks) and failed, even after soliciting the support of major exchanges."

For more advanced users it would be fine as a Bitcoin Core script"
2020-05-10,@lightcoin If it needs a node or to extract an xpub then it isn't suitable for newbies. I'm looking for a solution for newbies that can be run on any desktop without specialized knowledge or infrastructure prerequisites
2020-05-10,"@StNakamoto Wouldn't that require that you have your own fully indexed and unpruned  node?

2020-05-10,"Does anyone know of any such tool that could be safely applied on a seed, automating the discovery of UTXO on a broad range of derivation paths?

If it doesn't exist, would someone be interested in implementing it for a small bounty?"
2020-05-10,"That script was very basic and had to rely on a block explorer API, not a great solution.

interesting topic for sure."

•Bitcoin &amp; S&amp;P have been largely uncorrelated for years

•Corr has been at all time highs lately, which is not the norm"

2020-06-17,"Now you're probably scratching your head.

Are they uncorrelated like they've been for the majority 5+ years??

(likely reason: In a crisis everything sells off together as the driving force behind that decision is dominated by fear) https://t.co/Hn9nNSKGtA"
2020-06-17,"Another way to visualize the how Bitcoin's correlation has oscillated from little-to-no correlation with stocks is to look at how it has evolved over time.

This chart shows 2014-present.

Not a negative corr. Not a positive corr.

Movement from little-to-no corr the entire time. https://t.co/8IHfJQH21a"
2020-06-17,"Correlation is measured with a coefficient between 1 &amp; -1 which signal a strong positive relationship or a strong negative relationship.

• 0 corr to S&amp;P
• .08 avg corr to all other asset classes https://t.co/q3LClhoTtn"
2020-06-17,"Bitcoin has been UNcorrelated almost it's entire life. 

This makes sense for a few reasons:
•Different factors driving the valuation of a company vs a new form of money
•Less people/institutions own Bitcoin relative to how many own stocks
•The risks associated are different"
2020-06-17,"What is correlation?

The strength of a linear relationship between two variables. 

For our situation, the relationship between the returns of $BTC vs stocks."
2020-06-17,"The correlation between Bitcoin &amp; S&amp;P500 gets a lot of attention, &amp; rightfully so.

It's a big reason why $BTC is so attractive to hold in a portfolio.

This is largely because $BTC has been UNcorrelated to other asset classes for it's entirety.
